I believe that I might have a second chance to rehost Nostalgiacraft after reading a bit more on how the DMCA take down even happened and how I can avoid it?

# The NostalgiaCraft Project!
 By Samdan9 (Minecraft Chrome Dev)

## What is this?

NostalgiaCraft was a Project that I started in August of 2022, Updated until September 22, 2022, Discontinued November of 2022 and DMCA'ed March 13, 2023 as a result of the mass DMCA take down (I had source code since I forked the project)

# 90% of the original assets were changed.

All textures were changed, lighting was changed, sounds were changed, and even mobs were changed.

(there was a newer version of this however I didn't back up the project locally (haha stupid me) and has been lost to time.)

## What is the purpose?

This is a modified Eaglercraft client to give the look and feel of old beta Minecraft (but its secretly Minecraft 1.5.2)

## How do I play?

You can download the Offline download or use the Online version <a href="https://minecraftchromedev.github.io/NostalgiaCrafted/">Here</a>

## Thats it I guess

# UPDATE

This is important so listen up kiddos! Archive.org has just been unblocked in some districts but downloads for files still remain blocked.

This is good AND bad news:

This is mainly good news because there is a way to WGET files from the archive.org server!
and you are probably saying
WELL SAM... HOW IN THE HECKZIES WILL I EVER WGET ON A WEB BROWSER
introducing drumroll please...

# The Power of the Internet!! *Gitpod*

If you use python Django you should be able to open a terminal right in your browser!

Bad news:

Well Most kids my age don't even know what github is... so how do I expect them to make an account?
I don't.
But if you are smart enough you should be able to figure it out...
Y a y

Q&A

Q: Sam... what if Archive.org is still blocked?

A: You can try downloading it on your phone and put it in your drive so you can drag and drop the file!

Q: Is the anywhere else I can find this file?

A: No. If you find one somewhere other than my Archive do NOT touch it.

Q: What is a WGET?

A: Please just google it?

Q: What if Gitpod is blocked?

A: Oof, that is terrible! Do not fret! Try using Repl.it, and if that doesnt work refer to the first question.

Q: Will Nostalgiacraft ever upgrade to 1.8?

A: No.

Again thank you for the support!!
